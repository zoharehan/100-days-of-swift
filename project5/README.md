# WordScramble

This application gives the user a word and prompts them to enter other words that they can generate using letters from the given word. It utilises SwiftUI elements such as; Lists and NavigationViews and also explores onAppear() and onSubmit() functions.

The challenges completed are as follows:
1. Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
2. Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
3. Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the playerâ€™s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
