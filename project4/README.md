# BetterRest

This application takes user input indicating when they want to wake up, how long they want to sleep and their coffee intake and uses this information to predict their optimal bedtime.
It introduces new SwiftUI elements (Stepper, Picker, DatePicker) alongside Apple's machine leaning framework, CoreML.
